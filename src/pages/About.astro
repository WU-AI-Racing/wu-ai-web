      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        WashU AI Racing (WUAIR) is a dynamic and innovative organization
        dedicated to providing students with hands-on experience in AI,
        robotics, and autonomous systems. Our mission is to collaboratively
        design and build a multi-disciplinary software stack to drive a
        formula-style car autonomously, pushing students to solve real-world
        engineering challenges in a large, structured team environment.
      </p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        WashU has the chance to participate in Formula Student AI, an
        autonomous driving competition held at the Silverstone Track in the UK.
        Unlike traditional Formula Student teams that design and build a car
        from scratch, FSAI provides each team with a race carâ€”capable of
        reaching speeds over 80 mph. Our role will be to design and
        implement the sensor suite and software stack that enable the vehicle
        to autonomously navigate and race around the track as quickly and
        safely as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are seeking ambitious and motivated students to collaborate on this
        technically demanding project. By contributing, you will gain hands-on
        experience with cutting-edge AI, robotics, and autonomous systems,
        while working as part of a team solving real-world engineering
        challenges.
      </p>
